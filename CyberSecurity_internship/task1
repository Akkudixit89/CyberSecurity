Task 1: Scan Your Local Network for Open Ports

Objective: Learn to discover open ports on devices within your local network to understand network exposure and evaluate potential security risks.

Tools Used:

Nmap (free)

Wireshark (optional)

Step 1: Install Nmap
Downloaded and installed Nmap from the official site: https://nmap.org/download.html
Installation completed successfully on Windows (includes Zenmap GUI).

Step 2: Find Your Local IP Range
Ran ipconfig in Command Prompt.
Found IPv4 Address: 192.168.1.101
Found Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0
Local network IP range determined to be: 192.168.1.0/24

Step 3: Run TCP SYN Scan
Executed the command:
nmap -sS 192.168.1.0/24
This scanned all devices in the subnet using a TCP SYN (stealth) scan.

Step 4: Note Down IP Addresses and Open Ports Found
Sample Nmap Output:
Nmap scan report for 192.168.1.1
Host is up (1.0s latency).
PORT STATE SERVICE
80/tcp open http
443/tcp open https

Nmap scan report for 192.168.1.101
Host is up (0.0030s latency).
PORT STATE SERVICE
22/tcp open ssh
139/tcp open netbios-ssn
445/tcp open microsoft-ds

Devices Detected:

192.168.1.1 (Router): Ports 80 (HTTP), 443 (HTTPS)

192.168.1.101 (My PC): Ports 22 (SSH), 139/445 (Windows file sharing)

Step 5: (Optional) Analyze Packet Capture with Wireshark
Opened Wireshark and started a capture on the active network interface.
Applied filter: ip.addr == 192.168.1.1
Observed SYN packets sent from my PC to devices in the network and SYN-ACK responses from devices with open ports.

Step 6: Research Common Services Running on Those Ports

Port	Protocol	Common Service	Description
22	TCP	SSH	Secure remote login
80	TCP	HTTP	Web server
443	TCP	HTTPS	Secure web server
139	TCP	NetBIOS Session	Windows file/printer sharing
445	TCP	Microsoft-DS	SMB file sharing

Step 7: Identify Potential Security Risks from Open Ports

Port 22 (SSH): Safe if properly configured with strong passwords or SSH keys.

Ports 139/445 (SMB): May expose the system to SMB-based vulnerabilities like EternalBlue.

Port 80 (HTTP): Unencrypted web traffic; consider redirecting to HTTPS.

Recommendation: Close unused ports or restrict them via a firewall to reduce attack surface.

Conclusion:
Successfully scanned the local network using Nmap.
Discovered active devices and identified open ports.
Used Wireshark for optional packet-level analysis.
Researched services running on open ports and identified potential security risks.
